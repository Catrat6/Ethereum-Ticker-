# Ethereum Price Ticker

*Note: It is worth knowing, coin gecko seems a little slow to update the price, don't spam your refresh button over 
and over. I would give it at least a min. before refreshing*

A simple app using TKinter as a class to show the current price of ethereum.

## Features

- Small window/widget easy to place anywhere on your screen without taking up too much space.
- Refresh button to ensure you always have the most recent price data without wasting all your free api calls
- Color of price text updates so you know it refreshed even if price did not change.

## API key

You wont be able to use this without your own, this uses coin geckos free API tier they try to make 
it seem like the free tier is not enough. It is plenty, they also call it a demo account but yeah 
it is just a free tier that gives you 10,000 calls a month/30 a min.

## This project is functional but what is next

Just sanding out the edges and making it pretty and smooth. I may also make a little pop up field
to enter the API key so that pretty much anyone can use this. If I end up doing that I will probably completely
package this.

This was a fun project just to practice working with APIs, I may also add the ability to switch between other 
coins later.
